# x86-64 Instruction Set

Entries are documented as they are encountered during operations. 

Each entry consists of 

- definition
- use cases


## `\xcc`

### Definition

- software breakpoint

### Use Cases

- Debug buffer overflow payloads locally
- Adding breakpoints to buffer overflow payloads, investigate stack at some point in during payload execution.


## `\xe9`

### Definition

- jump, `jmp`.
- short jump.
- requires a 16 or 32 bit `rip` relative address to follow `\xe9`.
- 32 bit relative address is more common.

### Use Cases

- `ret` trampolines for function hooking.
- Windows function hooking.
