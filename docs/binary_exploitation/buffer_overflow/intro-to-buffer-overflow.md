## theory - stack based buffer overflow

> When compiling examples, dissable address randomization and stack protections. Use `gcc -fno-stack-protector -z exec stack` and ensure that `/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space` has value 1.

This category of exploits work because of the nature of the data structure called the stack. To accelerate our discussion, here are a few aspects of the stack data structure:

- used to store variables which have size/length at compilation time
- bytes get added to or removed from the stack with `push` and `pop` assembly instructions respectively
- the value of `rsp` register is an address that points to the most recent value added to the stack
- the value of `rbp` register is an address that points to the base of the stack frame
- during execution, each function gets its own stack frame
- when a value is added to the stack, the address inside `rsp` is *decremented*. **This is the fundamental feature that enables the exploit**. 
- when we write bytes to some location on the stack, consecutive bytes are written by *incrementing* the address we are writing to. Therefore whenever we write to the stack, if we mis manager our pointer then **we may overwrite data previously pushed to the stack.**

The intuition so far may be, "so what? we can overwrite data, maybe break something". However, it becomes clear how this can be weaponized once we examine exectution flow control. A major aspect of flow control is implemented by the stack, that being return addressing. When a function is called, we need a way to continue to execute the assembly instructions once the function has finished its work. When `functionA` calls `functionB` a new stack frame is built and two important values are saved onto the stack by doing `push` instructions. 

1. `push rip`
2. `push rbp`

> these values will be referred to as "saved `rip`" and "saved `rbp`", note that saved `rbp` is at a lower memory address than saved `rip` due to how the stack is implemented. 

The register `rip` contains an address that points to the next assembly instruction, by saving the value of `rip` on the stack, we can easily pick up where we left off after `functionB` finishes its work. Note that `rbp` is saved to the stack so that the context/scope of `functiionA` can easily be resumed, `rbp` being saved on the stack is not fundamental to achieving code execution. 

Time to put it all together. When user input is stored on the stack, there is a possibilty of this exploit occurring. Without proper controls, a user may provide longer and longer inputs. When these inputs are stored on the stack at some address, they are written by increasing the address for each consecutive byte. With sufficiently large input, the size of the stack frame may be exhuasted, overwriting  `functionA` 's  saved `rbp` value, and overwriting `functionA`'s saved `rip` value to any address the user wants. When `functionB` returns, instead of returning to `functionA`'s next instruction, exectution returns to the address provided by the user.

The impacts of this are limited to our own creativity and the size of the buffer on the stack. The traditional way to get arbitrary code exectution is to overwrite saved `rip` to be an address inside the buffer we can write to.  This is more easily done when access to the binary is available and we can debug to hunt for addresses. When debugging is not an option but binary is still available locally, spraying the buffer and hunting for relevant `dmesg` output is the best starting point. 



## methodology

### calculating the offset of saved RIP

The debugger `gdb-peda` offers tools for exploit development implemented in python. Below is procedure for getting the offset of saved `rip`:

1. debug the binary with `gdb-peda`
2. set breakpoint on `functionA` that calls `functionB`. Note that `funcitonB` contains the vulnerable buffer. Often `functionA` is simply `main`
3. use `pattern_create 500 pattern.txt` to write a file containinga non repeating sequence. Note these are often implemented as Debruijn sequences.
4. run the binary with the pattern in the buffer, `run < pattern.txt` for standard input or `run $(cat pattern.txt)` for `arvg[1]`
5. continue until program crashes, the current value of `rsp` is the address we tried to return to. We can print it via `x/wx $rsp`.  Call this `FAILED_RET`
6. We now need to find `FAILED_RET`, in our pattern. `gdb-peda` does this for us via `pattern_offset FAILED_RET`
7. `gdb-peda` yields the offset, lets say `n`. We can now build our payload. Note we will only have `n` bytes to include any shellcode, padding etc, that we want for our exploit.


```python
"A"*n + DESIRED_ADDRESS_LITTLE_ENDIAN
```



### NOP sled - guarantee correct return address - bypass address randomization

One difficulty associated with buffer overflow is finding which address to use when overwriting saved `rip` . This is further complicated when the system has robustly implemented address space layout randomaiziton (ASLR). We can reduce these challenges by utilizing a `NOP` sled. A `NOP` is an assembly instruction that results in *no operation*, it takes a moment of time, then proceeds to the next instruction.

By using the byte `\x90` as padding, we can overwrite saved `rip` to point at any of `NOP`s in the buffer.

This is especially potent when conditions reduce the amount of starting knowledge we can get about the binary.  Technique is powerful for implementing brute force solutions with scripting languages or for remote exploits.


### ROP chains - bypassing Data Execution Prevention

#### theory 

Data execution prevention is a policy implemented at compile time that stops execution from within the data section of the binary. The buffers we have been exploited thus far are all contained in the data section, this policy disables all of our established methods.

What we can do instead is leverage return oriented programming to "live off the land", using what is within the valid sections of the image to achieve what we want. With a library such as `libc`  (contains system calls) included in the image, we can get access to relevant strings such as

- `/bin/sh`
- `system()`
- `execve()`
- `dup2()`
- `NULL`
- more can be found by debugging with `gdb-peda` and using `find` to search for strings

#### procedure

To build a ROP chain, we need to 

1. get the offset of saved `rip`
2. we need addresses of relevant assembly instructions in the image
3. we need to respect calling convention, so to execute `system("/bin/sh")` we must first load the string into `rdi` then return to the address of `system()` i.e. `__libc_system`
4. we acheive this through gagets, we overwrite saved `rip` to point to the gaget `pop rdi; ret`
5. When the vulnerable function returns to the address of our gaget, **calling convention causes stack frame to be collapsed**, resulting in `rsp`  pointing to whatever was after saved `rip` in our payload. Therefore `rsp` is pointing to the correct position for the `pop` instruction. 

Okay, thats great. *How do I get the address ?* If debuggin is available, `gdb-peda` has two essential capabilities 

1. `find STRING_GOES_HERE` for finding string addresses
2. `asmsearch  pop ?; ret` for finding **any**  `pop` instructions, followed by `ret`

If debugging is unavailable, then it possible to remotely expose base addresses through the `/proc` file system. This is particularly attractive due to `/proc` frequently being accessible throuh remote information disclosure methods such as remote file inclusion. 

1. get base addresses from `/proc`
2. get offsets from the `libc.so.6` on your local system, may need to hunt versions if target is out of date
3. perform the calculation then proceed as detailed above
