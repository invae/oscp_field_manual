# opensource_targets

Opensource targets provide opportunity for unique enumeration techniques. Github, Subversion, or any other repository enables more passive enumeration techniques. Less interation with the target, more recon and research. 


## enumerating versions

Try to find a file in the source code that containts the version number explicitly or implied. In this case an example of "implied" would be a feature change only implemented after some commit, thus we can estimate the the version number. If we exhaust all methods and devolve to throwing exploits at the target, any version to narrow the scope of exploits is useful for the sake of time.
