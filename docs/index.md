This resource serves as a place to collect all my notes created during my preparations for the OSCP exam. I initially kept this offline as an obsidian vault but I have chosen to make them public for two reasons:

1. I have come to value the availability of having notes globally accessible
2. One of the most rewarding things for me is sharing things that I found difficult to learn or discover

I hope this resource can prove useful for others too.
