# Post Exploitation

These pages are guidelines for activity once Administrator or System has been achieved on a Windows host. These activities either directly achieve the objective or support continuing the pursuit of it. 

Actions should be taken in concentric circles, originating from the host we now own. The happy path is loosely as follows:

1. Enumerate local defenses
2. Create ad hoc networks
3. Loot credentials from the owned host
4. Intelligence collection targeting hosts, identities, or the objective
5. Enumerate local network
6. Target selection

Divergence from the happy path should be done deliberately. Do not attempt to justify the decision based off results. If the strategic merits of a choice cannot be shown, then the choice probably should not be made.
