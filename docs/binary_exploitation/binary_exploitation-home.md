## scripting repeated analysis

Bash redirection can be used to repeat command entry. Commands should be new line seperated. 

```bash
./bad_binary < commands.txt
```

Some binaries may become unresponsive, in which case tmux scripting is prefered. Employ the `run-shell` command and as script containing several `send-keys` commands. 

## analyzing file strings

> strings op!!!
```
strings -n 8 FILE_NAME  			; only display strings a min lenth of 8
```

> if strings fails, try `cat` on the binary. Have your terminal `reset` ready!

### multiple encoding types

Always try at least 2 encodings when doing strings analysis. Consult man page for full options

```bash
strings -e l ~/path/to/file
```

- `-e` to specifiy an ecoding
- `l` is 16-bit Little Endian
- `L` is 32-bit Little endian
- `b` is 16-bit Big Endian
- `B` is 32-bit Big Endian


## dynamic analysis

> sudo dmesg|tail ; john hammond methodology
```sh
sudo dmesg|tail # will yield feedback of the nature of a program crash
# useful for when we are attempting basic buffer over flows;
# feedback includes
# attempted return address; which is critical for calculating the offset required for the first return in ROP chain

#The dmesg command is a Linux utility that displays kernel-related messages retrieved from the kernel ring buffer. 
#The ring buffer stores information about hardware, device driver initialization, and messages from kernel modules that take place during system startup.
```

> `readelf`
```cmd
possibly for getting section info
```

> `strace` and `ltrace` ; note `ltrace` is more friendly
```cmd
dumps system calls observed during execution
```

> return orient programming; gaget search and creation tool

Really cool tool, need more exposure.


## gdb

```sh
set follow-fork-mode child           # follow the child process 
pattern create length                # length may be an integer
pattern offset RBP_VALUE_AT_CRASH    # get the offset of stored RIP
```

> use printf instead of python3; python2 is also okay
> python3 does some garbage with your hex, do not trust it
